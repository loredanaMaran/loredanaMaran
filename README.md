# Hi there, I'm Loredana 👋

### **Senior Full-Stack Engineer | AWS Certified Solutions Architect**

I am a product-minded engineer with over **10 years of experience** building scalable web applications. I don't just write code; I focus on solving real-world problems by bridging the gap between business requirements and high-quality technical implementation.

### 🚀 Engineering Philosophy

- **Product Ownership:** I enjoy taking a project from the initial wireframes and product specs to a fully deployed solution. I believe engineers should own the "Why" as much as the "How."
- **Maintainability First:** I follow **Clean Code** and **SOLID** principles not for academic reasons, but to ensure that the team can iterate fast without being slowed down by technical debt.
- **Async & Deliberate:** I thrive in environments that value deep focus time and clear, written communication.

### 🧶 Beyond the Code

When I'm not architecting software, you'll find me **creative sewing**. Designing complex patterns and assembling them requires the same precision, patience, and attention to detail as building a robust microservice.
